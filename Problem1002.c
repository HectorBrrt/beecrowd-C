/*
Area of a Circle
The formula to calculate the area of a circumference is defined as A = π . R2. Considering to this problem that π = 3.14159:
Calculate the area using the formula given in the problem description.
Input
The input contains a value of floating point (double precision), that is the variable R.
Output
Present the message "A=" followed by the value of the variable, 
as in the example bellow, with four places after the decimal point. Use all double precision variables.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double R;
    printf("R = ");
    scanf("%lf", &R);

    double A = 3.14159 * R*R;
    
    printf("A= %lf", A);
}
